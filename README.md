# Android Dice
An android application contains two dices used in tabletop games.

## Function

* Two D6s (red and blue)
* Roll one by touch it or roll two by touch "ROLL!" button
* Record 6 results

It may not be used in some games because it's quite simple now:
* AppIcon is default
* Cannot change dice color
* Cannot change dice texture
