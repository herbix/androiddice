# Android Dice
An android application contains two dices used in tabletop games.

## Function

* 1~4 D6s
* Roll one by touch it or roll two by touch "ROLL!" button
* Record 6 results
* Change dice from grey, red, blue, yellow, green

It may not be used in some games because it's quite simple now:
* Cannot change dice texture
